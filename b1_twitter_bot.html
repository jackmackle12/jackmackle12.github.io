        <p class="p">
            Since January 2021 I have held significant positions in the uranium sector thanks to the 
            advice of a friend. For the uninitiated, there is growing demand for nuclear fuel and
            supply uncertainty due to years of under-investment. Look into it. Please note: this 
            sector will rip your face off. 
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The uranium investment thesis is heavily discussed on Twitter. Or at least I find it is. 
            I wanted to contribute to the community and showcase my data skills through a personal
            project, so I decided to create <a href="https://twitter.com/u3o8_botman">u3o8_botman.</a>
            This bot is powered by a virtual machine (VM) and uses VADER - a sentiment analysis tool -  
            to determine the daily average sentiment of tweets containing '#uranium'. Is this information
            useful? Probably not, but it was fun to make. 
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            This blog will outline how I built the bot, specifically focusing on:
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Using the Tweepy library</li>
                <li>Using the VADER library</li>
                <li>Provisioning a virtual machine</li>
                <li>Automating scripts with crontab</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
